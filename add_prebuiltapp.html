<h1>###  SETPS TO ADD PREBUILT APP IN ANDROID OPEN SOURCE PROJECT
</h1>

<p>Adding a prebuilt app to an Android Open Source Project (AOSP) involves several steps. This process allows you to include a binary APK (Android Package) into the AOSP build system so that it is installed on the device as part of the system image. Here's a detailed guide:
</p>
<h3>### BUILD EMULATOR 
</h3>
<p>Open terminal </p>

<p>$cd       “working_directory”  (aosp12)</p>
<p>$source build/envsetup.sh</p>
<p>$ lunch</p>
<p>If you are getting this :</p>

<p>You're building on Linux</p>

<p>Warning: Cannot display lunch menu.</p>

<p>Note: You can invoke lunch with an explicit target:</p>

 <p> usage: lunch [target]</p>
<p>Which would you like? [aosp_cf_x86_64_phone-trunk_staging-eng]</p>
<p>Pick from common choices above (e.g. 13) or specify your own (e.g. aosp_barbet-trunk_staging-eng): </p>
<p>Run:</p>
<h6>$ export TARGET_RELEASE=trunk_staging</h6>
<h6>$ build_build_var_cache</h6>

<p>After that if you are getting this error:</p>
<p>In file included from build/make/core/config.mk:380:</p>
<p>In file included from build/make/core/envsetup.mk:51:</p>
<p>build/make/core/release_config.mk:145: error: No release config found for TARGET_RELEASE: trunk_staging. Available releases are: ap2a.</p>
<p>20:39:02 dumpvars failed with: exit status 1</p>

<p>Run This :<br>
    $cd       “working_directory”  (aosp12)<br>
    $source build/envsetup.sh<br>
    $export TARGET_RELEASE=ap2a<br>
    $build_build_var_cache<br>
    $ lunch<br>
    We will get the lunch menu:<br>
    <br>
    Pick from common choices above (e.g. 13) (if this is not working ) <br>
    </p>

   <p>Then Run: <br>
    lunch sdk_car_x86_64-ap2a-eng<br>
    (note:The form of the lunch sdk_car_x86_64-ap2a-eng  is lunch sdk_car_x86_64-$ap2a-$variant)<br>
    </p>


    <p>
        After selecting any of one from lunch menu build it :<br>
        $m -j$(number of jobs)<br>
    <br>
        After build emulator run this command to run the emulator :<br>
        $emulator -no-snapshot-load or emulator -wipe-data or emulator<br>
    </p>


    <p>
        Note:-  The difference between userdebug and eng :<br>
        the build system allows for additional apps to install<br>
         themselves in userdebug builds and eng builds independently
         <br> from the product configuration, via LOCAL_MODULE_TAGS. debug modules are <br>
         installed in userdebug and eng builds, eng modules are installed in eng builds.<br>
    </p>

    <h2># SETPS TO ADD PREBUILT </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>### 1. **Prepare the Prebuilt APK**</h1>
    <p>Ensure you have the APK file of the app you want to include. This APK <br>
        should be properly signed if it requires any special permissions<br>
         or system-level access.</p>

    <p>Let the app is (myapp.apk)</p>
    <h4>### 2. **Set Up the AOSP Build Environment**</h4>

    <p>
        Before you begin, ensure that your AOSP build environment is correctly set up. This involves:<br>

    - Cloning the AOSP source code.<br>
    - Setting up the build environment.<br>
    - Choosing the target device and build configuration.<br>
    </p>


   <h4> ### 3. **Create Directories for the Prebuilt App**</h4>

<p>Navigate to the AOSP root directory and create a directory structure for your prebuilt app within the `vendor` directory. 
</p>
<p>aosp12/packages/apps/Car/AMyApp</p>
<p>
AMyApp<br>
	-AMyApp.apk<br>
	-Android.bp<br>
	-myap.mk<br>
	-preinstalled-packages-AMyapp.xml <br>
</p>

<h4>### 4. **Create Android.mk,Android.bp,preinstalled-packages-AMyapp.xml File**</h4>
<p>Inside the directory where you placed the APK, create an `Android.mk` <br>file to specify how the APK should be included in the build:
    <p>
        AMyApp<br>
            -AMyApp.apk<br>
            -Android.bp<br>
            -myap.mk<br>
            -preinstalled-packages-AMyapp.xml <br>
        </p>

        <h3>### 5. **Register the Prebuilt App in the Build System** </h3>
        <p>Add the app to  the directory:</p>        
<br>    
         <p>  aosp12/packages/services/Car/car_product/build/car.mk</p>

         <p>

         # Automotive specific packages<br>
         PRODUCT_PACKAGES += \<br>
            CarFrameworkPackageStubs \<br>
            CarService \<br>
            CarShell \<br>

            AMyApp \<br>
            <br>
         </p>



         <h4>### 6. **Build the AOSP**</h4>
         <p>
            Now you are ready to build the AOSP with the prebuilt app included:<br>
            <br>


        $source build/envsetup.sh<br>
        $lunch <your_device>-eng<br>
        $make -j$<number_of_jobs><br>
         </p>
